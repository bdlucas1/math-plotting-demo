=== demo

=== transparent NumpyArrayListExpr vs opaque NumericArray
GraphicsComplex[3D] using NumericArray is nonstandard afaics
but NumpyArrayListExpr potentially fragile wrt performance

=== compile
good direction?
AST?
who?
testing?

=== layout
architecture ok?
dash vs ipywidgets
repository organization
    how to reuse across front-ends
how to package front-ends
jupyter/jupyterlite packaging - kernel
how to use in shell front-end
need browser front-end given jupyter?

=== Graphics3D
need GraphicsComplex for performance, but support across the board?
    with NumpyArrayListExpr or NumericArray?
boxing currently not standard
needs considerable build-out itself
how to test

=== Plot3D
needs considerable build-out
how to test
deploy unconditionally or conditionally
    former requires support across the board

=== ComplexPlot3D, etc
identify others that uses Graphics3D and build out

=== Graphics (2d)
GraphicsComplex needed?
support across the board?

=== Manipulate
non-standard ManipulateBox vs DynamicModule, Dymanic, Dynamic*Box, etc.
other functions like Animate?
