=== collaboration
something better than email?
like code review: shared doc with comments threads relating to specific items
DISCUSSION.md pull request? google doc? just use email?

=== demo
Bruce will quickly run through demos to make sure we're on same page
quick tour of demo code, maybe

=== transparent NumpyArrayListExpr vs opaque NumericArray
GraphicsComplex[3D] using NumericArray is nonstandard afaics
but NumpyArrayListExpr potentially fragile wrt performance
-> decision by email is NumericArray seems like a good idea

=== NumericArray
questions from https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/task_e_6909b81266188330b5b22bac0b27c272
questions from https://github.com/bdlucas1/mathics-core/tree/codex/implement-mathematica-numericarray-with-numpy

=== compile
good direction? by email: maybe for plotting only? but would we really want two compiler implementations?
AST vs code string?
    pro: avoids Little Bobby Tables issues
    con: maybe not completely stable?
who? Bruce? Rocky?
how to test
    maybe monkey-patch "evaluate" to be "compile and run"

=== layout
architecture ok?
analgous to format, but data structure instead of string
    any value to merging with format?
dash vs ipywidgets
repository organization
    how to reuse across front-ends
how to package front-ends
jupyter/jupyterlite packaging - kernel
how to use in shell front-end
need browser front-end given jupyter?

=== Graphics3D
need GraphicsComplex for performance, but support across the board?
    with NumpyArrayListExpr or NumericArray?
boxing currently not standard
needs considerable build-out itself
how to test

=== Plot3D
needs considerable build-out
how to test
deploy unconditionally or conditionally
    former requires support across the board

=== ComplexPlot3D, etc
identify others that uses Graphics3D and build out

=== Graphics (2d)
GraphicsComplex needed?
support across the board?

=== Manipulate
non-standard ManipulateBox vs DynamicModule, Dymanic, Dynamic*Box, etc.
other functions like Animate?
